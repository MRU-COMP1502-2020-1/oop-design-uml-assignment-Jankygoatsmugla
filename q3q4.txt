Q3:

prog 2 is better than prog 1 because the instance variable is private, which means you cant access it directly
(tightly coupled) leading to increased security. 

Q4:

It doesnt actually take in any data from the file name, URL, or network.

public String readFile(String fileName){
    String output = "";
    File file = new File(fileName);
    try{
      Scanner fileScanner = new Scanner(file);
      while(fileScanner.hasNext()){
        output += (fileScanner.nextLine()); 
        
      }
    }
    catch(FileNotFoundException e){
      return ("Unable to open: " + fileName);
    }


    return output;
  }

replace fileScanner with a buffered reader or something for URL/Network.
